Pattern Matching
----------------  
Being provided with a pattern "abab" and a string "catdogcatdog", return True.
A pattern "aba" with the string "bkkkkb" should also return true.
The pattern "ccc" with the string "aab" should return False.

This is a recursive implementation without the use of Regex.
